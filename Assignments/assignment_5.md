**Activity duration**: [TODO: Insert hours spend]

## Goal
We intend to implement the following three interaction techniques:

### Technique 1 - Hammer Time

For our first interaction Technique, we intend to experiment with letting the user destroy their own museum with extreme prejudice. Using marker interaction, we intend to let users put a marker on a hammer, or other destructive tools, and let them virtually destroy their own artifacts by hitting the artifacts with a hammer. We intend to implement this by adding an XR marker to track the hammer. When the marker hits the virtual space of a vase or any other artifact, we want to simulate, that the artifact is destroyed, preferrably with some animation to indicate, that the artifact is falling apart.

### Technique 2 - Watch your step

For the second interaction, we want to solidify the value and care, that is needed for ancient artifacts by implementing a system, that lets users knock the placed artifacts over when walking into them. We intend to implement this by measuring the relation in the form of the distance between the user and an artifact, and if the two are too close, we want to knock down the vase onto the ground.
