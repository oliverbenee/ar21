## Goal
We intend to implement the following three interaction techniques:

### Technique 1 - Theme plates. [Marker, Appearance]

For our first interaction technique, we intend to let the user to create general themes in their rooms using marker interaction. We want to let the user print out XR markers representative of a desired theme, and have the user tie placed artifacts to the marker. Any artifact, that is moved to this marker should change to the same material as that of the marker. Thus, the new object will fit the theme, that the user has decided for the area of the marker.

### Technique 2 - Watch your step [Proximity, animate]

For the second interaction, we want to solidify the value and care, that is needed for ancient artifacts by implementing a system, that lets users knock the placed artifacts over when a user walks into them. We intend to implement this by measuring the relation in the form of the distance between the user and an artifact, and if the two are too close, we want to knock down the vase onto the ground.

### Technique 3 - Degrading and Polishing [Gesture, Appearance]

The third technique, we intend to implement the ability for users to polish placed artifacts by shaking their phone at a placed artifact. The shaking of the artifact is intended to simulate rubbing the artifact with a piece of cloth or other polishing device. This way, the user will be able to gesture at a selected object to polish it.

For polishing of artifacts to hold any value to the user, the condition of the artifact must also be able to degrade. For this reason, we want to implement that over time the polish quality of the given artifact should be able to degrade, e.g. by the smoothness of the objects decreasing, adding dust patches, and fading colors.
