**Date**: [TODO: date]

**Group members participating**: [TODO: insert names]

**Activity duration**: [TODO: Insert hours spend]

## Goal
Formulate the new project idea. Implement object catalogue and assignment 4.

## Ancientize

We write this part as a note to ourselves on what we want to accomplish. We have decided to move away from the concept of BikeStorm due to the difficulty of implementation and it being outside of the scope of the course. 

The concept, titled "Ancientize" will let the user create a museum in their own home by adding ancient statues, sculptures, pillars, and pottery to create their own home museum with artifacts from a forgotten past.
